Shooting Locations Based on Missing Demographic Information of Pepertrator 

1. Project Description 

   Using data from the City of New York website, basic analysis was performed on shooting data from 2006-2021. The goal of this project was to learn how to create data
vizualisations in R. 

   In this project, the location of shootings was plotted and analyzed based on whether the perpatrator was missing demographic information. 

   After analyzing the locations of shootings, it was found that shootings with missing perpetrator demographics are more likely to occur on the west side of New York City,
whereas shootings with complete demographic information are more likely to occur on the east side. With that said, this was over a 15-year period, and should, therefore,
be analyzed with finer granularity to determine whether or not this conclusion of shooting density applies to recent trends.
